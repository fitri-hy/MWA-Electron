### What is M-WA?

WhatsApp Web basically only supports one account session on one browser. M-WA overcomes this limitation by allowing you to run multiple WhatsApp accounts simultaneously, without having to log out and log in back and forth.

This is very useful for users who have multiple WhatsApp numbers for business, customer service, or personal purposes.
